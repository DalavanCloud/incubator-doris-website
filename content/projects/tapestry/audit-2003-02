A code audit started on Feb 20 2003.  It is based on the 2.4 code branch (which is nearing the 2.4-alpha-3 release).

The following external JARs are in CVS.  All are redistributed with the Tapestry distribution (except as noted).  All are needed to compile the framework, and at runtime (except as noted).

* jcommon-0.6.5.jar -- LGPL -- Used to compile and run some examples. 
* jdom-b8.jar -- -- Used only to build and run JUnit test suite.  <b>Not redistributed</b>
* jfreechart-0.9.2.jar -- LGPL -- Used to compile and run some examples.
* junit.jar -- -- Used only to build and run JUnit test suite.  <b>Not redistributed</b>
* mckoidb-0.94h.jar -- GPL -- Used to compile the contrib framework, used in demos.  <b>See note below</b>.
* ognl-2.3.0-opt.jar -- Modern BSD
* org.apache.crimson.jar -- ASL
* bcel-5.0.jar -- ASL
* bsf-2.3.0.jar -- ASL
* commons-lang-1.0.jar -- ASL
* commons-logging-1.0.2.jar -- ASL
* ejb.jar -- LGPL -- <b>To be removed shortly, in 2.4-alpha-3++</b>
* jakarta-oro-2.0.6.jar -- ASL
* javax.servlet.jar -- ASL
* javax.xml.jaxp.jar -- ASL

<b>mckoidb-0.94h.jar</b>: McKoi is GPL.  The tiny amount of code in contrib that calls into McKoi has been transfered to the McKoi project.  My understanding of the GPL is that the current code is not in violation, since McKoi is distributed with Tapestry ... but I'm easily confused.

It is expected that the next release of McKoi will have the necessary code changes (its JMX code to allow a McKoi instance to run inside JBoss), and we will be able to strip out the code from contrib, fully resolving the conflict.  I expect to be able to redistribute McKoi, without any Tapestry code compiled against it, with a clear concience.

''gstein: LGPL and GPL code cannot reside in the Apache repository. Those need to be removed ASAP. Developers and users will need to fetch them from somewhere else, manually. Note that there are still questions about even using LPGL code; that is being resolved on the community@apache.org list right now, I believe. The table above is missing licenses for several components. That must also be cleared up. Java code cannot 'import' any code that is GPL'd. That creates a specific dependency on the GPL'd code, which then infects the calling code. Thus, I don't see any way that we could use McKoi in any fashion.''

''HLS:Although I could direct users to download McKoi separately, I need the JMX code that imports McKoi, or I have to scrap the turn-key demos.  I believe the next release of McKoi will include these code contributions and I'll be able to strip out the offending code at that time.''

''HLS:I will look into removing jfreechart and jcommon.  Probably have to direct users to download it separately.''

''AndrewCOliver: Howard, you don't undestand, you need to remove the McKoi code immediately and any code which links to it.  This isn't even grey area.  It is clearly in violation of the GPL license.''

I've been trying to avoid doing this, but looks like I'm going to have to pull the McKoi JMX code out entirely.  I've been hoping I could wait it out until Toby (the McKoi guy) rolls the JMX stuff into McKoi -- then it just is a matter of directing users to pick up right version of McKoi.

My plan is:
# Remove the McKoi JMX code from CVS
# Create a new module at Tapestry @ SourceForge containing the code (all twenty lines or so) as a GPL framework.
# Direct people to download the new framework.

ETA on this is 3/7/2003.
