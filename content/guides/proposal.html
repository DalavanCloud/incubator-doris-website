 <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>This document is descriptive, not normative. It describes approaches to drawing up a proposal for submission. It is not an inflexible standard but represents a consensus condensed from discussions on the <a href="lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org">general mailing list</a>.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="background">Background</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p><a href="entry.html">Entry</a> to the incubator is a democratic <a href="/incubation/Process_Description">process</a> decided by a vote. The proposal is the document upon which the <a href="/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Sponsor">Sponsor</a> votes. So, though itâ€™s neither necessary nor sufficient to have a good proposal, a good proposal increases the chances of a positive result.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Proposals to the incubator generate attention. The <a href="lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org">general mailing list</a> is open, widely discussed and well indexed. It is a very public space. The proposal is a manifesto. A good proposal should target also the wider audience and not just the <a href="/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Incubator+Project+Management+Committee+%28PMC%29">jury</a>. Use this time to engage and inform potential <a href="participation.html#developer">developers</a> and <a href="participation.html#user">users</a>.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Much of the information will be reused in the <a href="sites.html">Podling website</a>. A good proposal should shape the future evolution of the project but each proposal captures only the particular instant at birth. It is understood that projects change and evolve.</p>

   <h3 id="continuous_improvement">Continuous Improvement</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>The <a href="/incubation/Process_Description.html">Incubation process</a> is continuously evolving. Hopefully this will help newer projects to be even stronger and more successful then existing ones. One consequence of this approach is that precedence is not always a reliable guide. Another is that documentation may be a little outdated.</p>

  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Start with research. The <a href="entry.html">incubator entry guide</a> is a good place to start. Read the <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation">documentation</a>.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p><a href="lists.html">Subscribe</a> to the <a href="lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org">general mailing list</a>. Spend some time reviewing the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/">mailing lists archives</a>. The mailing lists are the canonical form of <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#communication">communication</a> and <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#decision-making">decision making</a> at Apache. Documentation is an attempt to codify the consensus formed and record the decisions taken on list.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Before starting on the formal proposal, recruit a <a href="/incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Champion">Champion</a>. The Champion understands Apache and should be able to help navigate the process.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Review <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/">recent proposals</a> and how they have been <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/">received</a>.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>The incoming community needs to work together before presenting this proposal to the incubator. Think about and discuss future goals and the reasons for coming to Apache. Feel free to ask questions <a href="lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org">on list</a>.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Every proposal is different. There will always be some aspects which do not seem to fit well into the <a href="#proposal-template">template</a>. Use the template as a guide but do not feel constrained by it. Adopt what works and change what doesnâ€™t. Thatâ€™s fine - in fact, itâ€™s expected.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Be sure to add your proposal to <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ProjectProposals">this list</a>.</p> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="project_name">Project Name</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>While it is important to ensure a <a href="graduation.html#notes-names">suitable project name</a> and product names sometime during incubation, it is not necessary to do this prior to entering incubation. In fact, be careful not to disrupt your proposal and entry process.</p> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="presentation">Presentation</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Once the preparatory work is done, the proposal should be presented to the incubator. Post the proposal in plain text in an email to the <a href="lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org">mailing list</a> whose subject is prefixed with <em>[PROPOSAL]</em>. You should be clear that you want to discuss your proposal when submitting this mail.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>If there is interest in the proposal, expect a lively debate to begin. Approval is an open and <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html">democratic</a> <a href="entry.html#understanding">process</a>. Discussion is an important part of opinion formation. A proposal will require development if it is to gain the maximum level of support from the <a href="/whoweare.html">electorate</a>.</p> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="developing_the_proposal">Developing The Proposal</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Expect to work on improving the proposal on the list after presenting it. No preparation can cover every question. It is usual for unexpected and novel questions to be asked. This is often a sign of interest. So (though it may sometimes feel like an ordeal) approach these questions as a positive opportunity.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>The <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/">wiki</a> is a good development tool. Consider creating a wiki page containing the evolving proposal content. Those who are interested should add themselves to the watch list for the page so they can receive change notifications.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Developing the proposal on the wiki allows easy collaboration. This has disadvantages as well as advantages. The wiki is just a tool to assist the easy development of the final proposal (the one that will be voted upon). Not every change improves a proposal and there is no requirement that every change is accepted by the proposers. Note that the incubator asks all participants to abide by appropriate <a href="participation.html">netiquette</a>.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Effective management of this development is an exercise in community building. The wiki is not an appropriate forum for debating changes. Discussion should be gently moved onto the appropriate <a href="lists.html#general+at+incubator.apache.org">mailing list</a>.</p> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="the_vote">The Vote</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>When the proposal seems finished and some sort of consensus has emerged, the proposal should be put to a vote.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>If the wiki is used to develop the proposal, please ensure that the wiki matches the final proposal then add a notice to the wiki that development of the document is now complete:</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="literalblock"> 
    <div class="content"> 
     <pre>/!\ '''FINAL''' /!\

This proposal is now complete and has been submitted for a VOTE.</pre> 
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Embed the final proposal text or a link to a specific revision number of the wiki proposal page in the email which kicks off the VOTE thread. If a change is required after the vote has been called then the vote must be cancelled, the change made, and the vote restarted. Alternatively, Mentors will advise on how to make the change once the proposal has been accepted if this is appropriate. Do not edit the wiki proposal unless you cancel the vote thread.</p> 
   </div>

<div class="sect1"> 
 <h2 id="proposal_template">Proposal Template</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The aim of presenting a template with examples and comments is educational. Proposals are not required to adopt this format. Every proposal is different. There may be sections which donâ€™t seem to be useful. Itâ€™s fine to miss them out and to add new ones that the proposal seems to need. Best practice evolves. Innovation is acceptable.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The format is less important than the content.</p>

  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>Each section is broken down into a commentary/explanation and examples, in the following format</p>

  <div class="literalblock"> 
   <div class="content"> 
    <pre>== Abstract ==
Commentary:

  A short descriptive summary of the
  project. A short paragraph, ideally one sentence in length.

  The abstract should be suitable for reuse in

the board resolution used to create the official project upon graduation,
  as the first paragraph on the podling web site and in the DOAP document.

Examples:

  Geronimo will be a J2EE
compliant container.

  Heraldry will develop technologies around the emerging user-centric
  identity space.

  Yoko will be a CORBA server.


= Proposal =

Commentary:

  A lengthier
description of the proposal. Should be reasonably declarative. More discursive material should be included in the rationale (or other later sections).

Example:

  XAP is to provide an XML-based
declarative framework for building,
  deploying and maintaining rich, interactive, Ajax-powered web
  applications. A basic principal of XAP is to leverage existing Ajax


=== Background
===
Commentary:

  Provides context for those unfamiliar with the problem space and history.

  Explain terms whose meanings may be misunderstood (for example, where there is not a single widely
adopted definition).

  This content should be capable of being safely ignored by domain experts. It should probably find an eventual home on the Podling website.

Example (Heraldry):

  To
provide some background, the Higgins Project is being actively
  developed within Eclipse and is a framework that will enable users
  and enterprises to integrate identity, profile, and
relationship
  information across multiple systems. Using context providers,
  existing and new systems such as directories, collaboration spaces
  ...

=== Rationale ===
Commentary:


Explains why this project needs to exist and why should it be adopted by Apache. This is the right place for discursive material.

Example (Beehive):

  There is a strong need for a cohesive,
easy-to-use programming model
  for building J2EE applications. Developers new to Java are forced to
  learn a myriad of APIs just to build simple applications; advanced
  J2EE developers are
forced to write tedious plumbing code; and tools
  authors are limited in what they can do to simplify the experience
  due to the underlying complexity.

=== Initial Goals ===
Commentary:
  A
complex proposal (involving multiple existing code bases, for example) may cause concerns about its practicality. A good way to address these concerns is to create a plan that demonstrates the
proposal is feasible and has been carefully thought through.

  Many projects will not need this section.


Example (Heraldry):

  * Expansion of Yadis and OpenID libraries into additional
languages
    beyond the existing Python, Ruby, Perl, and PHP libraries
  * OpenID authentication specification revision to fix known security
    considerations, investigate compatibility with the
DIX IETF
    proposal, describe Yadis integration, and allow either an URL or
    XRI be used as the End User's Identifier

=== Current Status ===
Commentary:
  This section (and the contained
topics) describes the candidate's current status and development practices. This should be an honest assessment balancing these against Apache's principles and development ideals.

  For some
proposals, this is a chance to demonstrate understanding of the issues that will need to addressed before graduation. For others, this is a chance to highlight the close match with Apache that already
exists. Proposals without an initial code base should just simply state that.

  Some proposals name this section criteria (though the term is a little misleading).

 *
'''Meritocracy:'''

Commentary:

  Apache is a meritocracy.

  Once a developer has submitted enough good patches then it should be natural that they are elected to committer. It should be
natural that active committers are elected to the project management committee (PMC).

  This process of renewal is vital to the long term health of Apache projects. This is the right place to
demonstrate that this process is understood by the proposers.


Example (OFBiz):

  OFBiz was originally created by David E. Jones and Andy Zeneski in
  May 2001. The project now has committers
and users from around the
  world. The newer committers of the project joined in subsequent
  years by initially submitting patches, then having commit privileges
  for some of the applications,
and then privileges over a larger
  range of applications...

Example (Beehive):

  We plan to do everything possible to encourage an environment that
  supports a meritocracy. One of the
lessons that the XMLBeans
  committers have learned is that meritocracies don't just evolve
  from good intentions; they require actively asking the community
  for help, listing/specifying the
work that needs to be done, and
  keeping track of and encouraging members of the community who make
  any contributions...

 * '''Community:'''
Commentary:

  Apache is interested only
in communities.

  Candidates should start with a community and have the potential to grow and renew this community by attracting new users and developers. Explain how the proposal fits this
vision.

Example (Beehive):

  BEA has been building a community around predecessors to this
  framework for the last two years. There is currently an active
  newsgroup that should help us
build a new community at Apache.

Example (WebWork2):

  The WebWork 2 community has a strong following with active mailing
  lists and forums.

Example (WADI):

  The need for a full service
clustering and caching component in the
  open source is tremendous as its use can be applied in many areas,
  thus providing the potential for an incredibly large community.

 * '''Core
Developers:'''

Apache is composed of individuals.

It is useful to provide a brief introduction to the developers on the initial committers list. This is best done here (and not in that
section). This section may be used to discuss the diversity of the core development team.


Example (ServiceMix)
  The core developers are a diverse group of developers many of which
  are
already very experienced open source developers. There is at
  least one Apache Member together with a number of other existing
  Apache Committers along with folks from various companies.

http://servicemix.org/Team

Example (WADI)
  WADI was founded by Jules Gosnell in 2004, it now has a strong base
  of developers from Geronimo, Castor, OpenEJB, Mojo, Jetty,
  ActiveCluster,
ActiveMQ, and ServiceMix.

 * '''Alignment:'''

Describe why Apache is a good match for the proposal. An opportunity to highlight links with Apache projects and development
philosophy.


Example (Beehive):
  The initial code base is targeted to run within Tomcat, but the goal
  is to allow the framework to run on any compliant Servlet or J2EE
  container. The Web
services component, based on JSR-181, will
  leverage Axis. The NetUI component builds on top of Struts. The
  underlying Controls component framework uses Velocity. There are
  other projects that
we will need to work with, such as the Portals
  and Maven projects.

'''Known Risks'''

An exercise in self-knowledge. Risks don't mean that a project is unacceptable. If they are
recognized and noted then they can be addressed during incubation.

 * '''Orphaned products''':

A public commitment to future development.

Recruiting a diverse development community and
strong user base takes time. Apache needs to be confident that the proposers are committed.


Example (Yoko):
  The contributors are leading vendors in this space. There is no risk
  of any of
the usual warning signs of orphaned or abandoned code.



Example (Ivy):
Due to its small number of committers, there is a risk of being orphaned.
The main knowledge of the codebase is still
mainly owned by Xavier Hanin.
Even if Xavier has no plan to leave Ivy development, this is a problem we
are aware of and know that need to be worked on so that the project become
less dependent on
an individual.



Example (Tika):
There are a number of projects at various stages of maturity that implement
a subset of the proposed features in Tika. For many potential users the
existing
tools are already enough, which reduces the demand for a more
generic toolkit. This can also be seen in the slow progress of this proposal
over the past year.

However, once the project gets
started we can quickly reach the feature level
of existing tools based on seed code from sources mentioned below. After that
we believe to be able to quickly grow the developer and user communities
based
on the benefits of a generic toolkit over custom alternatives.

 * '''Inexperience with Open Source:'''


If the proposal is based on an existing open source project with a history
of open development, then highlight this here.

If the list of initial committers contains developers with strong open source backgrounds then highlight this here.

Inexperience with open source
is one reason why closed projects choose to apply for incubation. Apache has developed over the years a store of experience in this area. Successfully opening up a closed project means an investment
of energy by all involved. It requires a willingness to learn and to give back to the community. If the proposal is based around a closed project and comes with very little understand of the open
source space, then acknowledge this and demonstrate a willingness to learn.


Example (Cayenne):
  Cayenne was started as an open source project in 2001 and has
  remained so for 5
years.



Example (Beehive):
  Many of the committers have experience working on open source
  projects. Five of them have experience as committers on other
  Apache projects.



Example
(Ivy):
  While distributed under an open source license, access to Ivy was initially
  limited with no public access to the issue tracking system or svn
  repository. While things have changed
since then - the svn repository is
  publicly accessible, a JIRA instance has been setup since june 2005, many
  new features are first discussed on the forum or JIRA - experience with a
  true
open source development model is currently limited.
  However, Maarten has already a good experience with true open development
  process, and bring his experience to the project.



Example
(River):
  The initial committers have varying degrees of experience with open source
  projects. All have been involved with source code that has been released under
  an open source license, but
there is limited experience developing code with an
  open source development process. We do not, however, expect any difficulty in
  executing under normal meritocracy rules.

 * '''Length of Incubation:'''
Commentary:
  This section describes how long the project is expected to be in incubation before it's graducation as a top level project and the reaosns for that.

  This shows the project has thought about the steps required to graduate and that there are not any unrealistic expectations.

 * '''Homogenous
Developers:'''

Healthy projects need a mix of developers. Open development requires a commitment to encouraging a diverse mixture. This includes the art of working as part of a geographically
scattered group in a distributed environment.

Starting with a homogenous community does not prevent a project from entering incubation. But for those projects, a commitment to creating a diverse
mix of developers is useful. Those projects who already have a mix should take this chance to highlight that they do.


Example (Beehive):
  The current list of committers includes developers from
several
  different companies plus many independent volunteers. The committers
  are geographically distributed across the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
  They are experienced with working in a
distributed environment.



Example (River)
  Since the Jini Technology Starter Kit has been mainly developed to date by Sun
  Microsystems, the vast majority of initial committers to the
project are from
  Sun. Over the years, Sun has received bug fixes and enhancements from other
  developers which have been incorporated into the code. Our plan is to work with
  these other
developers and add them as committers as we progress. There are
  three other initial committers (non Sun): Bill Venners, Dan Creswell, and Mark
  Brouwer. Bill is the lead of the Service UI API
work, Dan has been involved with
  much Jini-based development, including an implementation of the JavaSpaces
  service called Blitz &lt;http://www.dancres.org/blitz/&gt;, and Mark is veteran of
  much
Jini-based development, including commercial work at Virgil
  &lt;http://www.virgil.nl&gt; as well as leading the open source Cheiron
  &lt;http://www.cheiron.org&gt; project.



Example (Ivy):
  With only
two core developers, at least they are not homogenous! Xavier and
  Maarten knew each other only due to their common interest in Ivy.

 * '''Reliance on Salaried Developers''':

A project
dominated by salaried developers who are interested in the code only whilst they are employed to do so risks its long term health.

Apache is about people, not corporations. We hope that developers
continue to be involved with Apache no matter who their current employer happens to be.

This is a right place to indicate the initial balance between salaried developers and volunteers. It's also
good to talk about the level of commitment of the developers.


Example (OpenJPA):
  Most of the developers are paid by their employer to contribute to
  this project, but given the anticipation
from the Java community for
  the a JPA implementation and the committers' sense of ownership for
  the code, the project would continue without issue if no salaried
  developers contributed to
the project.



Example (River):
  It is expected that Jini development will occur on both salaried time and on
  volunteer time, after hours. While there is reliance on salaried developers

(currently from Sun, but it's expected that other company's salaried developers
  will also be involved), the Jini Community is very active and things should
  balance out fairly quickly. In the
meantime, Sun will support the project in the
  future by dedicating 'work time' to Jini, so that there is a smooth transition.



Example (Wicket):
  None of the developers rely on Wicket for
consulting work, though two -
  Martijn and Eelco -  are writing Wicket In Action (publisher Manning) in
  their spare time. Most of the developers use Wicket for their day jobs,
  some for
multiple projects, and will do so for a considerable while as
  their companies (specifically Topicus, Cemron and Teachscape) choose
  Wicket as their development framework of choice.

 *
'''Relationships with Other Apache Products:'''

Apache projects should be open to collaboration with other open source projects both within Apache and without. Candidates should be willing to
reach outside their own little bubbles.

This is a an opportunity to talk about existing links. It is also the right place to talk about potential future links and plans.

Apache allows different
projects to have competing or overlapping goals. However, this should mean friendly competition between codebases and cordial cooperation between communities.

It is not always obvious whether a
candidate is a direct competitor to an existing project, an indirect competitor (same problem space, different ecological niche) or are just peers with some overlap. In the case of indirect
competition, it is important that the abstract describes accurately the niche. Direct competitors should expect to be asked to summarize architectural differences and similarities to existing
projects.


Example (OpenJPA):
  Open JPA will likely be used by Geronimo, requires some Apache
  products (regexp, commons collections, commons lang, commons pool),
  and supports Apache
commons logging.

Example (River)
  Currently the only tie to Apache projects is the starter kit's use
  of the Ant build tool. There are potential future ties (http server,
  database backend,
etc)that will be explored.

 * '''A Excessive Fascination with the Apache Brand:'''

Concerns have been raised in the past that some projects appear to have been proposed just to generate
positive publicity for the proposers. This is the right place to convince everyone that is not the case.

This is also the right place to build bridges with the community after past misdemeanors
(for example, if any of those associated with the proposal have - in the past - sort to associate themselves with the Apache brand in factually incorrect ways) and promise good conduct for the
future.


Example (CeltiXfire):
  While we expect the Apache brand may help attract more contributors,
  our interests in starting this project is based on the factors
  mentioned in the
Rationale section. However, we will be sensitive to
  inadvertent abuse of the Apache brand and will work with the
  Incubator PMC and the PRC to ensure the brand policies are
respected.



Example (Wicket):
  The ASF has a strong brand, and that brand is in itself attractive.
  However, the developers of Wicket have been quite successful on
  their own and could
continue on that path with no problems at all.
  We are interested in joining the ASF in order to increase our
  contacts and visibility in the open source world. Furthermore, we
  have been
enthusiastic users of Apache from the earliest hour
  (remember JServ anyone?), and feel honored at getting the
  opportunity to join the club.



Example (OpenJPA):
  We think that Open JPA is
something that will benefit from wide
  collaboration, being able to build a community of developers and
  committers that outlive the founders, and that will be embraced
  by other Apache efforts,
such as the Geronimo project.

'''Initial Source'''

Describes the origin of the proposed code base. If the initial code arrives from more than one source,
this is the right place to outline the different histories.

If there is no initial source, note that here.


Example (Heraldry):
  OpenID has been in development since the summer of 2005. It
currently
  has an active community (over 15 million enabled accounts) and
  libraries in a variety of languages. Additionally it is supported by
  LiveJournal.com and is continuing to gain
traction in the Open
  Source Community.

  Yadis has been in development since late 2005 and the specification
  has not changed since early 2006. Like OpenID, it has libraries in
  various
languages and there is a large overlap between the two
  communities. The specification is...


'''Source and Intellectual Property Submission Plan'''

Complex proposals (typically
involving multiple code bases) may find it useful to draw up an initial plan for the submission of the code here. Demonstrate that the proposal is practical.


Example (Heraldry):
  * The OpenID
specification and content on openid.net from Brad
    Fitzpatrick of Six Apart, Ltd. and David Recordon of VeriSign,
    Inc.
  * The domains openid.net and yadis.org from Brad Fitzpatrick of

Six Apart, Ltd. and Johannes Ernst of NetMesh, Inc.
  * OpenID libraries in Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and C# from JanRain,
    Inc.
    ...
  * Yadis conformance test suite from NetMesh and
VeriSign, Inc.

  We will also be soliciting contributions of further plugins and
  patches to various pieces of Open Source software.

'''External Dependencies''':

 External
dependencies for the initial source is important. Only some external dependencies are allowed by Apache policy. These restrictions are (to some extent) initially relaxed for projects under
incubation.

 If the initial source has dependencies which would prevent graduation then this is the right place to indicate how these issues will be resolved.


 Example (CeltiXfire):
   The
dependencies all have Apache compatible licenses. These include
   BSD, CDDL, CPL, MPL and MIT licensed dependencies.

'''Cryptography'''

If the proposal involves cryptographic code either
directly or indirectly, Apache needs to know so that the relevant paperwork can be obtained.

'''Required Resources''':

 * '''Mailing lists:'''

 The minimum required lists are
private@{podling}.incubator.apache.org (for confidential PPMC discussions) and dev@{podling}.incubator.apache.org lists. Note that projects historically misnamed the private list pmc. To avoid
confusion over appropriate usage it was resolved that all such lists be renamed.

 If this project is new to open source, then starting with these minimum lists is the best approach. The initial
focus needs to be on recruiting new developers. Early adopters are potential developers. As momentum is gained, the community may decide to create commit and user lists as they become necessary.


Existing open source projects moving to Apache will probably want to adopt the same mailing list set up here as they have already. However, there is no necessity that all mailing lists be created
during bootstrapping. New mailing lists can be added by a VOTE on the Podling list.

 By default, commits for {podling} will be emailed to commits@{podling}.incubator.apache.org. It is therefore
recommended that this naming convention is adopted.

 Mailing list options are described at greater length elsewhere.


 Example (Beehive):
   * private@beehive.incubator.apache.org (with
moderated subscriptions)
   * dev@beehive.incubator.apache.org
   * commits@beehive.incubator.apache.org


 * '''Subversion Directory:'''

 It is conventional to use all lower case,
dash-separated (-) directory names. The directory should be within the incubator directory space (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator).


         Example (OpenJPA):

https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa



 * '''Git Repositories:'''
  It is conventional to use all lower case, dash-separated (-) repository names. The repository should be
prefixed with incubator and later renamed assuming the project is promoted to a TLP.


              Example (Blur):

https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-blur.git


 * '''Issue Tracking:'''

 Apache runs JIRA and Bugzilla. Choose one. Indicate the name by which project should be known in the
issue tracking system.


 Example (OpenJPA):
   JIRA Open-JPA (OPEN-JPA)


 * '''Other Resources:'''

 Describe here any other special infrastructure requirements necessary for the
proposal. Note that the infrastructure team usually requires a compelling argument before new services are allowed on core hardware. Most proposals should not require this section.

 Most standard
resources not covered above (such as continuous integration) should be added after bootstrapping. The infrastructure documentation explains the process.


'''Initial Committers'''

List of
committers (stating name and an email address) used to bootstrap the community. Mark each which has submitted a contributor license agreement (CLA). Existing committers should use their apache.org
email address (since they require only appropriate karma). Others should use the email address that is (or will be) on the CLA. That makes it easy to match CLAs with proposed committers to the
project.

It is a good idea to submit CLAs at the same time as the proposal. Nothing is lost by having a CLA on file at Apache but processing may take some time.

Note this and this. Consider
creating a separate section where interested developers can express an interest (and possibly leave a brief introduction) or ask them to post to the general list.


Example (OpenJPA):
  Abe White
(awhite at bea dot com)
  Marc Prud'hommeaux (mprudhom at bea dot com)
  Patrick Linskey (plinskey at bea dot com)
  ...
  Geir Magnusson Jr (geirm at apache dot org) *
  Craig Russell (clr at
apache dot org) *

'''Sponsors'''

Little bit of a controversial subject. Committers at Apache are individuals and work here on their own behalf. They are judged on their merits not their
affiliations. However, in the spirit of full disclosure, it is useful for any current affiliations which may effect the perceived independence of the initial committers to be listed openly at the
start.

For example, those in salaried positions whose job is to work on the project should list their affiliation. Having this list helps to judge how much diversity exists in the initial list and
so how much work there is to do.

This is best done in a separate section away from the committers list.

Only the affiliations of committers on the initial bootstrap list are relevant. These
committers have not been added by the usual meritocratic process. It is strongly recommended that the once a project is bootstrapped, developers are judged by their contributions and not by their
background. This list should not be maintained after the bootstrap has been completed.

 * '''Champion:'''
  The Champion is a person already associated with Apache who leads the proposal
process. It is common - but not necessary - for the Champion to also be proposed as a Mentor.

  A Champion should be found while the proposal is still being formulated. Their role is to help
formulate the proposal and work with you to resolve comments and questions put forth by the IPMC while reviewing the proposal.

 * '''Nominated Mentors:'''

Lists eligible (and willing)
individuals nominated as Mentors [definition] for the candidate.

Three Mentors gives a quorum and allows a Podling more autonomy from the Incubator PMC, so the current consensus is that three
Mentors is a good number. Any experienced Apache community member can provide informal mentorship anyway, what's important is to make sure the podling has enough regularly available mentors to
progress smoothly. There is no restriction on the number of mentors, formal or informal, a Podling may have.


 * '''Sponsoring Entity''':
  The Sponsor is the organizational unit within
Apache taking responsibility for this proposal. The sponsoring entity can be:

  - the Apache Board
  - the Incubator
  - another Apache project
  The PMC for the appropriate project will decide
whether to sponsor (by a vote). Unless there are strong links to an existing Apache project, it is recommended that the proposal asks that the Incubator for sponsorship.

  Note that the final
destination within the Apache organizational structure will be decided upon graduation.</pre>
