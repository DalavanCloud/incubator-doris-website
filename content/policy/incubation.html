   <p>In October 2002 the Board of Directors of the Apache Software Foundation passed a resolution creating the Apache Incubator PMC (referred to as the "Incubator PMC" in this document) charged with "accepting new products into the Foundation, providing guidance and support to help each new product engender their own collaborative community, educating new developers in the philosophy and guidelines for collaborative development as defined by the members of the Foundation, and proposing to the board the promotion of such products to independent PMC status once their community has reached maturity" (reference Board Resolution).</p>

   <h3 id="releases">Releases</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>See the guidelines for <a href="/guides/releasemanagement.html">Podling releases</a> in conjunction with this policy. Podlings are not yet fully accepted as part of the Apache Software Foundation. No release made by a Podling will be endorsed by the ASF. Unendorsed releases may be made by Podlings subject to the following policy. Podlings in Incubation SHALL NOT perform any releases of software without the explicit approval of the Incubator PMC. Such approval SHALL be given only after the Incubator PMC has followed the process detailed in these guidelines, and SHALL NOT occur until all source has been legally transferred to the ASF. Therefore, should a Podling decide it wishes to perform a release, the Podling SHALL hold a vote on the Podling’s public dev list. At least three +1 votes are required (see the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html">Apache Voting Process</a> page). If the majority of all votes is positive, then the Podling SHALL send a summary of that vote to the Incubator’s <a href="/howtoparticipate.html#Mailing+lists">general</a> list and formally request the Incubator PMC approve such a release. Three +1 Incubator PMC votes are required. Below is an example showing how an incubating project managed this process:</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="ulist"> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p><a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-stdcxx-dev/200601.mbox/%3c43C1C0A0.7040401@roguewave.com%3e">Post to the Podling dev list calling the vote.</a></p> </li> 
     <li> <p><a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200601.mbox/%3c43D7AC9E.30205@roguewave.com%3e">Post to the Incubator’s general list requesting approval from the Incubator PMC.</a></p> </li> 
    </ul> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Should the Incubator PMC, in accordance with these guidelines vote to approve the request, the Podling MAY perform the release under the following constraints:</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="ulist"> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <p>the release archive MUST contain the word "incubating" in the filename; and</p> </li> 
     <li> <p>the release archive MUST contain an Incubation disclaimer (as described in the previous section), clearly visible in the main documentation or README file.</p> </li> 
    </ul> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Releases for <strong>podling</strong> MUST be distributed through <strong>http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/<em>podling</em></strong> In addition, the Podling MAY choose to distribute approved releases through other channels like the central Maven repository.</p>

   <h3 id="use_of_apache_resources">Use of Apache Resources</h3>
