 <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The intent of this document is to help podlings the importance of building an open and diverse community for their project. It gives guidelines on how to accept new committers and PPMC members, and how to enable more community involvement, taking off the burden of answering every question yourself.</p> 
  </div> 
 </div>

<div class="sect1"> 
 <h2 id="what_is_an_open_and_diverse_community">What is an open and diverse community?</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>A major criterion for graduation is to have developed an open and diverse <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Meritocracy">meritocratic</a> community. Time has demonstrated that these kinds of communities are more robust and productive than more closed ones.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="people">People</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>As a project grows, it needs to renew itself by accepting new committers. A project needs to learn how it can recruit new developers and committers into the community. Accepting new committers usually increases the diversity of the project. So, this process is very beneficial. <a href="#notes-community">Community building</a> requires energy which could have been spent on code development but this cost is an important investment for the future of the project.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>The openness of the community is not only measured by the number of contributors. Open and respectful discussions on the mailing lists are vital. Ways to resolve technical conflict without destroying personal relationships must be learned.</p> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="communication">Communication</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Mailing lists are the life blood of Apache communities. They are the primary mode of discourse and constitute a public and historic record of the project. Other forms of communication (P2P, F2F, personal emails and so on) are secondary. There are well founded fears about use of these media for project communication. Though many projects successfully blend other forms of communications, care needs to be taken since out-of-band communications have led to difficulties in the past. The reason is that communications on other than the public mail aliases exclude parts of the community. Even publicly advertised IRC chats can be exclusionary due to time zone constraints or conflicting time commitments by community members who might want to participate.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Apache project mailing lists are public, well indexed and well archived. This allows anyone to monitor (both in real time and by browsing the archives) what’s happening. Opinions expressed are public and poor behavior risks a poster’s reputation.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Private communications tend to be more candid but also more likely to be ill-judged. Back channel communication tend to be divisive, excluding some members of the group. This tends to have a corrosive effect on the collective spirit of the community. Mistrust builds when opinions backed by blocks of developers arise fully formed on list.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Communication through other channels also reduces the chance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity">serendipity</a>. As with most social networks, most subscribers to a mailing list never post and most posts come from a tiny minority of subscribers. Some passive subscribers are just interested in where the project is going but others understand related fields and have a limited intersection of interest. This second group will often post when this topic arises on list. Using public mailing lists to develop designs allows the chance encounter of ideas which often results in innovation.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>If alternative forums are used by a project, it is important to try to minimize the chances of problems arising. All matters of substance need to be moved back to the mailing lists. Public records should be kept and posted back to the list. Regular reminders should be posted to remind people that other secondary forms of communication exist.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>There are a limited number of topics such as security issues and discussions about people which are best handled in private. As much business of the project as possible should take place on public lists but the private list is available for those matters of a sensitive nature. Good netiquette requires that permission from the poster should be sought before making public, posts made to a private list. Try to avoid cross-posting between public and private forums. Take care not to post a reply to a private post to a public forum without permission.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Learning to use mailing lists effectively is very important. If this can be achieved, then you have shown to be a lively, active and successful community. The future looks bright.</p> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="sect2"> 
   <h3 id="community_building">Community Building</h3> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>Before a podling graduates, it must create a diverse and self-sustaining community. Community building is tough: it takes time, effort and more than a little magic. There is no secret recipe, just hard work. In order to overcome this obstacle, committers may need to devote more time to community building and less to development.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>The <a href="mailto:community@apache.org">community mailing list</a> is open to all Apache committers. This is the right list for questions about community and on community building. Subscriptions should be from an Apache email address.</p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="sect3"> 
    <h4 id="raising_the_profile">Raising The Profile</h4> 
    <div class="paragraph"> 
     <p>Sometimes, a podling is just not well-enough known. There are simply not enough users to allow new developers to be recruited. Overcoming this means finding ways to raise the profile of the podling. Some ideas:</p> 
    </div> 
    <div class="ulist"> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <p>Improve the website</p> </li> 
      <li> <p>Improve the information provided within each release and release more often</p> </li> 
      <li> <p>Committers who blog should join <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html#planetapache">PlanetApache</a></p> </li> 
      <li> <p>Use grassroots media</p> </li> 
      <li> <p>Encourage downstream distributions to include a packaged version</p> </li> 
      <li> <p>Submit talks to conferences</p> </li> 
      <li> <p><a href="http://www.feathercast.org">Feathercast</a></p> </li> 
      <li> <p>Write articles</p> </li> 
     </ul> 
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div class="sect3"> 
    <h4 id="building_a_community_by_stepping_back_a_little">Building a community by stepping back a little</h4> 
    <div class="paragraph"> 
     <p>If the podling has lots of users but very few new developers then this means that more work is required to encourage users to become developers. A common cause of this is that committers are too quick to create code to solve user problems. It’s good to respond quickly to requests by users. However, once a project gains momentum, it may be more productive for the long term health of a project to encourage users to become more involved at the expense of user satisfaction.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div class="paragraph"> 
     <p>Try to encourage expert users to answer questions. This may mean intentionally allowing a time gap before answering user questions. Encourage users to post by taking the time to deal politely and positively with misunderstandings and by replying to threads which have been answered well by a user to confirm that they are right. Avoid engaging in flame wars on user lists. Ignore trolls.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div class="paragraph"> 
     <p>Try to encourage users to become developers. When they give a good answer that isn’t covered in the documentation, ask them to submit a patch. When users suggest a good design or extension, ask for volunteers to help implement rather than just coding it up.</p> 
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div class="sect3"> 
    <h4 id="helping_developers_become_committers">Helping Developers Become Committers</h4> 
    <div class="paragraph"> 
     <p>If a podling has no trouble attracting developers but trouble retaining them long enough for them to become committers then this highlights an issue with the recruitment process. To become an Apache committer, a developer needs to hang around long enough to accumulate a track record of contributions. This often requires encouragement and help from existing committers.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div class="paragraph"> 
     <p>Promptly reviewing patches is important. The way that patches are applied is also important. Provide credit in the commit message and when closing the JIRA. It’s also good to encourage developers by suggesting new related work they may like to volunteer for.</p>
