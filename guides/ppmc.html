 <h2 id="podling_project_management_committee_ppmc">Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC)</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) helps a Podling learn how to govern itself. It works like a PMC but reports to the Incubator PMC instead of to the ASF Board. Initially, it is composed of the Podlingâ€™s mentors and initial committers. The PPMC is directly responsible for the oversight of the podling and it also decides who to add as a PPMC member.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>For general information about PMCs, see the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html">PMC FAQ</a>.</p>

</div> 
<div class="sect1"> 
 <h2 id="private_mail_list">Private Mail List</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>A private mail list, named private@<strong>project</strong>, lets the PPMC discuss confidential topics. <strong>Most communication should be on the Podlingâ€™s dev list!</strong> The private list is used only for confidential discussions that should not be made public, such as the suitability of a particular individual to become a committer or a member of the PPMC. See the ASF <strong>How it Works</strong> section titled <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#confidential">Balancing confidentiality and public discussion</a>.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The mentors should verify that all PPMC members are actually subscribed to the private list. Mailing list moderators can request the list of subscribers using ezmlm commands, and any subscriber can send a "ping - please reply" message to check who is actually "listening" to the PPMC list.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p><strong>Donâ€™t mix private and public lists in posts!</strong></p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="ulist"> 
   <ul> 
    <li> <p>Donâ€™t post to both the dev and private lists. Each member of the PPMC should be on the dev list, so posting to dev is sufficient.</p> </li> 
    <li> <p>Likewise, donâ€™t post to both the Incubator general and Incubator private lists. Each member of the Incubator PMC is on the Incubator general list, so posting to general is sufficient.</p> </li>

 <h2 id="podling_status_reports">Podling Status Reports</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>On a regular basis, reports from each incubating project are aggregated and sent to the ASF Board. Watch the Incubator general mail list for when these become due.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The Incubator reports to the ASF Board monthly and includes status for a subset of the incubating projects. Currently new Podlings report to the Incubator monthly for the first three months, then quarterly thereafter. The <a href="../report-groups.txt">reporting schedule</a> is generated from podlings.xml.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The PPMC does not have to fill out the report itself; the PPMC is just responsible for making sure that it gets filled out. In fact, it is better to discuss the report on the dev list and ask Podling developers to contribute to it. If Mentors disagree with the posted report, they should say so; otherwise, the Incubator PMC will assume that it speaks for the community.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>Please add the following items: - Project name and one-line summary. - Date of entry to the Incubator. - Top three items to resolve before graduation.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>Here are the points to be addressed: - Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs to address? - Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?) - Check that the projectâ€™s Incubation <a href="../projects/index.html">Status</a> file up to date. (Also provide the URL.) - What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report? - What are the plans and expectations for the next period? - Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly for you? - etc. (your own thoughts on what is important would be helpful!)</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>It is required for mentors to sign off on podling reports. - Mentors must sign off on the podling report. If there is no mentor sign off, the report from that podling will not be accepted and they will be moved to monthly, expected to report next month.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>Podling reports get added to the Incubator wiki - All podling reports must be added to the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/">Incubator wiki</a> - Follow the instructions in your monthly reminder, and post on the &lt;Month&gt;&lt;Year&gt; page, with the provided template</p>

<div class="sect1"> 
 <h2 id="project_status_page">Project Status Page</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>In addition to the quarterly status reports, each Podling has a page on the Incubator web site that tracks the status (see the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/index.html">complete list</a> for examples). Instructions for updating the status page are in the <a href="website.html">Incubator web site guide</a> under <a href="website.html#Edit+your+project+status+page">Edit your project status report</a>.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>This is one of the primary <a href="mentor.html#Overview">sources</a> of information about your podlingâ€™s status to the Incubator PMC and to the general public. Be sure to keep it updated as your podling progresses!</p>

 <h2 id="adding_new_committers">Adding new committers</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>Adding new committers is one of the most important functions of any PMC, and Incubator podlings are no different.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>There are no ASF wide rules on how to decide when to make someone a committer, podlings need to agree an approach that works for them. Some ASF projects have a high bar requiring significant contributions before someone is considered, other projects grant it more freely to anyone who shows interest in contributing. Some projects use formal [DISCUSS] and [VOTE] threads on the private mailing list, others use a more lazy consensus approach. For more information see, <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#CommitAccess">commit access</a> and the ASF <strong>How it Works</strong> document, which explains <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy"> meritocracy</a> and <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles"> roles</a>.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The podling Incubator reports should document any new committers added since the last report.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>Once the decision has been made the proposer offers committership to the nominee. If the nominee accepts the responsibility of being a committer for the project, the nominee formally becomes an Apache committer.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The proposer then asks an Incubator PMC member (typically one of the mentors) to follow the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newcommitter">documented</a> <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#SVNaccess">procedures</a> to complete the process. If the nominee is already an Apache committer on another project, the Incubator PMC member simply <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#SVNaccess">updates</a> the SVN authorization settings to include the nominee as a committer on the podling.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>The proposer then directs the new committer to the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/">Apache developerâ€™s pages</a>, to the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator site</a> and to the Incubator <a href="committer.html">Committers Guide</a> for important additional information.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>For projects which wish to have all committers also be PPMC members, the "Voting in a new PPMC member" guide below should then be followed, noting that if desired it is possible to run a joint committership and PPMC vote, providing that the guidance for both is followed.</p> 
  </div> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<div class="sect1"> 
 <h2 id="voting_in_a_new_ppmc_member">Voting in a new PPMC member</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>It should be a goal of a podling to have all committers participate in the PPMC. The PPMC should take an active role in watching committers develop into community participants, identify those who are participating at a community level, not just a technical one, and approach them with an offer of PPMC membership.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>Any member of the PPMC can propose a new member of the PPMC. The proposal should be discussed in private on the PPMC private alias, with a subject line of [DISCUSS] Joe Bob PPMC membership. If there is consensus that the proposed member is suitable, then there should be a formal vote in the PPMC private alias, with the subject line of [VOTE] Joe Bob PPMC membership.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>If the vote is successful, the proposer should send a message to the PPMC private alias, with the subject line of [VOTE][RESULT] Joe Bob PPMC membership. The message id of the [VOTE][RESULT] message should be preserved for notifying the Incubator PMC. The nominating PPMC member should send a message to the IPMC (<a href="mailto:private@incubator.apache.org">private@incubator.apache.org</a>) with a reference to the vote resultâ€™s message id of the following form:</p>

For projects which choose to always make new committers also PPMC members, simply updating the committer list and ensuring that a statement such as "The PPMC consists of all the committers and mentors listed here" is generally sufficient.</p>

 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>At times, it may be desirable to add a new mentor to a podling. Under all circumstances, a mentor must be an IPMC member.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>IPMC members are free to volunteer to be a mentor to a podling as they see fit. To do so, they should mail the podling stating their intentions. The podling should then decide if it wants to add the new mentor or not. If a decision has been reached to add the mentor, then all podling documentation should be updated to reflect the change (podlings.xml, projects/{podling}.xml) and the incubator be notified of the change as well.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>If a podling is in a position where they feel they need to add a new mentor, they may want to drop a mail on the general incubator mailing list to try to recruit a new mentor.</p>

 <div class="sectionbody"> 
  <div class="paragraph"> 
   <p>Occasionally it may be necessary to remove a mentor who has been too busy to participate or who has gone silent. After discussing it with the PPMC you can have someone with access (another mentor) remove them via <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/ppmc/">Whimsy</a>. An email will be generated by Whimsy so no email to the list is needed.</p>

   <p>The only time when a PPMC memberâ€™s vote is binding is for the addition of new PPMC members and committers. Release votes are only binding to IPMC members.</p>
